    <p> So to start off, hello my name is Gary and I'm here to help you with your
      car needs. I'm going to turn you into a car enthusiast/tuner in no time so you
      can get out there and experience the car culture at it's finest.</p>

    <p> To start the enthusiast life you need a car, so here is a link to a
      page where there are great and cheap options for amazing
      <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g115/10-sports-cars-under-10000/">cars.</a>
      Now you picked the car you want, now it's time to custimize it. <a href="https://www.carid.com/">Carid.com</a>
      is a great place to find gurenteed parts and car accesories for a great
      price. They have a variety of options and a vast variety of cars to
      choose from so you will understand the parts of your car even before
      you buy it.</p>

      <p> So now you picked your car, car parts, and design, now we get to
        the color options for your car. You can pick between three options:
        1) Plasti Dip, 2) Vinyl Wrap, 3) Full Paint change. Eveyone of these
        options have their pros and cons which I will explain. <a href="https://www.dipyourcar.com/">Plasti Dip</a>
        is the cheapest out of all options and easiest to do, which means you
        can even do it yourself and appreciate what you accomplished, also
        it is not permanent so you can always go back to your stock color, but
        the plasti dip acts like a real paint so it can create oversaturated spots,
        undersaturation, and problems paint may have. Next is <a href="https://www.metrorestyling.com/wrap-vinyl-s/23.htm">Vinyl Wrap</a>
         which is priced in the middle of all options, it is good to give you an extrta layer
        of protection to your paint, not permanent, and have many options, but
       it would need proffesional wrapping to put on your car. Next is <a href="https://www.paintforcars.com/acrylic-enamel-auto-paint-starfire-gallons.html">Full Paint</a>
       which is the most expensive out of all options, gives extra layer of
       protection, tremendous amount of color options, but is permanent and needs
       proffesional application.</p>

       <p> Now its time to find your car, best place to find cars at great prices
         ar at <a href="https://www.cargurus.com/">CarGurus.com</a> where you can
         search for the specific car you are looking for in your area and understand
